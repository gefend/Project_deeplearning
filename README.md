# Project_deeplearning

## Introduction
We worked with 40 classes from the “Quick, Draw!” dataset that includes labeled sketches that were drawn in less than 20 seconds and based ourselves on a project from a Kaggle competition on this dataset [argus quick draw]( https://github.com/lRomul/argus-quick-draw).
We improved the accuracy by adding a special augmentation to the sketches called “shake pen” and reached 94.9% accuracy on the test set.
